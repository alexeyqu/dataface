# MadIdea recognition project

The people with autistic (~1% of all the people!) and some other disorders often have major problems with recognizing faces of people around them.
This state is call prosopagnosia.
This problem has no solution without technologies, as without the face people change clothes, hair style and become unrecognizable again.

We have built a hardware solution on Raspberry Pi and a camera to interactively solve the task of recognition to keep it simple.

What can it do?
- Keep and proceed information offline (no internet needed; privacy respected)
- Recognize known faces from the video stream
- Easy add unknown faces to the lib when you are getting to know people

What can we do after?
- Better UI
- Deleting wrong guesses to improve tech
- Better AI stack
